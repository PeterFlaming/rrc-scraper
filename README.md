Messing around with scraping public production and test data from the Texas Railroad Commission.

### Useful URLs:
* http://webapps2.rrc.state.tx.us/EWA/wellboreQueryAction.do -> Wellbore information from API number [API -> (District, Lease)]
** Also provides link to detailed lease information (including well type)
* http://webapps2.rrc.state.tx.us/EWA/specificLeaseQueryAction.do -> Lease production information from lease information [(District, Lease, Well Type, Date Range) -> Production]
